The maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the largest possible sum 
of a contiguous subarray, within a given one-dimensional array A[1â€¦n] of numbers.

For example, 
If the array is :
[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]

for the array given above, 
the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is [4, -1, 2, 1], with sum 6.
