# Window Sliding Technique
In sliding window technique, we maintain a window that satisfies the problem constraints.
The window is unstable if it violates the problem constraints and it tries stabilize by increasing or decreasing it’s size.

##This technique shows how a nested for loop in few problems can be converted to
single for loop and hence reducing the time complexity.

##Sliding window technique is useful for solving problems in array or string, 
especially it is considered as a technique that could reduce the time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).
